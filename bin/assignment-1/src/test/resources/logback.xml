        Defines the level of the root logger (e.g. Debug). The logger will therefore only log messages with the
        configured level or higher (Info, Warn and Error). Messages that are logged with a lower level, like "Trace"
        will be filtered by the logger.
        Possible levels are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR.

        http://logback.qos.ch/manual/architecture.html

        Examples:
        > When the level is set to WARN, only WARN and ERROR messages are logged
        > When the level is set to DEBUG, only DEBUG, INFO, WARN und ERROR messages are logged
        > When the level is set to TRACE, all messages are logged (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR)
    -->

    <!-- By default we set the level to debug, so all message, except TRACE, are logged. -->
