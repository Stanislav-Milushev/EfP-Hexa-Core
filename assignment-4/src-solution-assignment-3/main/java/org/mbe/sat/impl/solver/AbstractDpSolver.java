/**
 * Abstract recursive SAT solver that builds up a decision tree and eliminates tree branches if its partial assignment
 * can never lead to satisfiable assignment. Therefore it greatly reduces the number of comparisons and evaluations that
 * have to be made. This class is an implementation of the Davisâ€“Putnam algorithm. It leaves the simplification step
 * open to be implemented by the subclass, so that different simplification techniques such as PLE or UP can be tested
 * on this basic algorithm. When extending this class, the abstract method {@link #simplifyFormula(CnfFormula,
 * Assignment)} must be overwritten, which is the first method to be called in each recursive step.
